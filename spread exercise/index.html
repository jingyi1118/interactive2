    <p>The Lamborghini Sián is the Italian automaker's first hybrid supercar to go into production, boasting an electric powertrain that makes it the "fastest Lamborghini of all time".

Unveiled ahead of the Frankfurt Motor Show 2019, the Lamborghini Sián is car maker's first hybrid model to go into production.

With a 785 horsepower V12 engine and a 34 horsepower electric motor, the hybrid model produces a combined thermal and electric power of 819 horsepower (602 kilowatts).

According to the company, this makes it the most powerful Lamborghini ever produced. While Lamborghini has teased conceptual electric sports cars such as the Terzo Millennio, the new hybrid car marks a significant step on the company's drive towards electrification.
